    <h1>MY FIRST WEBPAGE
        <!--this is question one-->
        <hr size="2">
        <h3> <p>I'm really surprised and proud at the same time. You must be wondering why? <br> "smiles", I am doing something i never imagined or dreamed i could ever do in my entire life. <br>I am writing "my first web page", it's amazing right! I know. All gratitude to my father and maker, HATOFF to CAPACITY BAY, a big thank you to all her tutors and teams members for turning this dream into a reality. I'm not a computer professional for start but right now i could things that some people could not do, I'm thankful for that. To my dearest chidimma, thank you for recommending it to me.<br> As a child, i have always admired people in movies that sits around beautiful offices with large desk and stacks of papers to work on and i aways wonder what they are working on. *little me and my imagination*, sha i considered them smart, and hardworking. <br> Growing up, the only thing i could ever do with a computer is to play games and watch movies and animation, till I had to work on my project and that was the only time I was determined to work with a computer my self and I think i learnt a great deal especially the basic of computer. <br> With lessons from capacity bay, I could improved my skills, learn new and better skills and most importantly earn money with my skills "tempting right?". One of the biggest challenges I encounter with my online classes is "TIME". Yes time, I am an interior designer and i know you may be wondering what I sew, I sew bedsheets, duvets, trowpillows, curtains and cushion trowpillows and due to the nature of my job I barely have time for myself or to practice what i have learnt cause I work morning till night, I get home by 8.pm most night and other nights 8:30pm but i always ensure that I always have time to attend classes, truth be told, it's exhausting. Permit me to put a full stop here till further notice. </p>

<h1> <p> I am working toward self improvement because I love progress. I hate slow progress, i have always been a fast learner but in this class I'm abit slow. <br> Feel it's because i have always been a lab person and barely have time to practice. But this assignment has been a turning point for me as i could go a long way without asking for assistance shows I have learnt a great deal. Thank capacity bay for not giving up on me.</p></h1>
